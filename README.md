## Lightning Algo

Similar to a word jumble game, Lightning Algo randomizes the lines of an algorithm, and let's you drag them back into the correct order. 

With Lightning Algo, the name of the game is speed. Create custom lists of algorithms, then work on cycling through and descrambling them quickly to beat your previous best times. 

Lightning Algo gives you a way to quickly and actively review all the algorithms that you need to know for your upcoming interview.
